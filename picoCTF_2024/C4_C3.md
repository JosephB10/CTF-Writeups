## Hints

- Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.


## Solution
You are given the cipher text of an encrypted python script and the python source code that encrypted it.
<br>
This is a 2 step problem. 


### Step 1


#### Encryption


The first step is to decrypt the cipher text.
- It takes the string you input and then splits it into individual chars to be encrypted
- There are two `keys` used to encrypt the chars

- The script starts at the first char and gets it's index in the first key
- Then subtracts it from the index of the previous char in the first key
- It takes that subtracted number and uses it as an index to select a char from the second key, which is the new encrypted char
- In this way it goes through the string encrypting 1 char at a time

#### Decryption
It just takes a relatively simple python script to reverse those operations.
- Get the index value of the cipher char in the second key
- Add that index value with the index value of the previous char from the FIRST key
- Use that index value on the first key to get the right char

```
#Cipher Text
info="DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnR..."

#Keys
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"


answer = ""
nextv = 0     #Previous Value

for char in info:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)             #Get the index from key2
    test = lookup1[(cur + nextv)%40]      # Stay under 40 and get the index by reversing operations
    nextv = lookup1.index(test)           # Get index for next char
    answer += test                        

print(answer)
```
<br><br><br>
---
### Step 2
After decrypting the cipher you get this script.
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
	chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
	if i == b * b * b:
		print chars[i] #prints
		b += 1 / 1
```
Now maybe I'm missing something, but the first two comments `#asciiorder` and `#fortychars` don't actually relate to the solution. 
<br><br>
I got stuck here for ~9 hours grinding through every possible variation I could imagine of 40 characters in ascii order. 
I'll post my notes at the bottom of this writeup to illustrate my thought processes.
<br><br>

The actual solution is to follow the third and fourth comments. `#selfinput` and `#python2`
- In the line `for line in input():` add a new filename in the brackets of `input()`
  - `for line in input("example.py"):`

- Then create a file `example.py` in the same directory and copy paste the decrypted code into it
  - The `.py` isn't necessary

- Run the script with python2 `python2 decryptedScript.py` and it will spit out the flag

## Rabbit Hole

This is my notes for things I tried on step 2, trying to find the solution.
<br>
I was able to figure out the solution when I was redoing this list double checking every result.
<br><br>
Things I've tried 

- non-writeable ascii symbols 0-40 suffixes 
	- non-writeable ascii symbols 0-40 suffixes and spaces
	- non-writeable ascii symbols 0-40 full names
	- non-writeable ascii symbols 0-40 full names and spaces
	- non-writeable ascii symbols 0-40 with full names for the punctuation
- ascii writeable char starting at `A` and going for 40 char
	- ascii writeable char starting at `!` and going for 40 char
- Both variables given in the first code (`lookup1` and `lookup2`)
- The first 40 char from the cipher code
	- The first 40 char from the cipher code sorted into a list by their ascii order
	- The entire cipher text split into 40 character blocks and individually sorted by ascii order
	- The cipher text split into 40 character blocks (This is the same as if it was entered together)
	- The cipher text split into 40 character blocks and then sorted by their first letter as it appears in the ascii table
- The comments are 36 characters long but I tried it anyway
- The hint isn't 40 char

- Now trying to fill up chars with a 40 char string and then have input be the cipher text
	- chars starting at A and going 40 characters wasn't it
	- chars starting at A and going 40 characters skipping special char wasn't it
	- chars starting at Space and going 40 characters wasn't it
	- chars starting at ! and going 40 characters wasn't it
	- Tried sorting the cipher by ascii order and 40 Alphabet char
	- Tried sorting the cipher by ascii order and 40 ascii char with special char
	- chars = non-writable ascii suffix without spaces and `input` = cipher text
	- chars = non-writable ascii suffix with spaces and `input` = cipher text

- Using the .py file in input and `chars` = alphabet repeating
- Using the .py file in input and `chars` = alphabet then symbols
- using the .py file in input and `chars` = lookup1
- using the .py file in input and `chars` = lookup2
- using the .py file in input and `chars` = first 40 char from ciphertext
